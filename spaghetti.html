    <p>my mother hated spaghetti, said it reminded her of home (make up 3 more paragraphs)</p>

    <p>ignredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>spaghetti</li>
        <li>sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
    <li>boil the water in a deep pot (you'll know it's boiling if there's bubbles duh)
    </li>
    <li>pour all your spaghetti in (if it doesn't fit abort mission)</li>
    <li>i forgot you had to season it, but go back and do that</li>
    <li>drink all the spaghetti water until your spaghetti has no more water(obvious)</li>
